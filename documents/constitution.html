      <h1>Constitution</h1>
      <h2>Information Security Club</h2>
      <p>
        The name of this club will be the Information Security
        Club. We are not an agent or representative of the
        Federation of Students, and our views and actions in no way
        represent the Federation of Students.
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the club is to gather University of Waterloo
        students, staff, and faculty to discuss matters relating to
        information security, including both conventional security
        and offensive security. The club's aim will be to improve
        the University's reputation in security-related matters,
        as well as promote the study of security across the region.
        We plan to hold meetings, educational seminars, challenges
        for members and for the public, and social events.
      <h2>Membership Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Membership is open to all members of the University of
        Waterloo and members of the community at large, of which
        only University of Waterloo students (graduate and
        undergraduate) may hold executive positions. Only University
        of Waterloo students are eligible to vote on club decision
        making measures. University of Waterloo undergraduates
        will make up a majority of all club executive positions.
        Staff, faculty, and members of the community at large may
        hold nonvoting associate memberships and may not hold any
        executive positions.
      <h2>Membership Fee</h2>
      <p>
        The membership fee is $5 cash per term payable to the
        Treasurer no later than one month after the first day of
        class. If joining after the first month, membership is due
        at the beginning of the first club function.
      <h2>Executive Officers</h2>
      <h3>President</h3>
      <p>
        A President does not hold power to make decisions for the
        whole group. Rather, he/she ensures that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the club operates according the the guidelines of its
          constitution, and some agreed-upon guidelines for running
          a meeting, such as Robertâ€™s Rules of Order, at his/her
          discretion;
        <li>
          the club works towards its objectives as agreed upon by the
          membership; and
        <li>
          that the next President is trained.
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is important to assure that the person with the most
        information and knowledge in the club is not the full-time
        President &mdash; therefore, the club will occasionally
        rotate the role of chairperson among members.
      <h3>Secretary</h3>
      <p>
        A Secretary ensures that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          records of what the group has done are maintained,
          distributed and are accessible to all the members;
        <li>
          minutes/notes are taken at all meetings;
        <li>
          all club correspondence is monitored and brought to the
          attention of the appropriate person(s);
        <li>
          the duties of the President are undertaken in his/her
          absense; and
        <li>
          that the next Secretary is trained.
      </ul>
      <h3>Treasurer</h3>
      <p>
        A Treasurer is responsible for:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the bank account with the Federation of Students and
          all financial transactions for the club; and
        <li>
          that the next Treasurer is trained.
      </ul>
      <p>
        The President, Secretary, and the Treasurer will be signing
        authorities for the club.
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>
        We will hold biweekly general meetings and weekly executive
        meetings. The general meetings must be held in-person, but
        executive meetings are allowed to be hosted online with consensus
        of all executives. The first meeting of the following term will
        be set up by the outgoing executive. At that meeting, subsequent
        meeting times and locations will be set. Meeting times and dates
        will be forwarded to members via email. Quorum will be 7 people
        for general meetings and 2 for executive meetings. An emergency
        meeting can be called by any executive via email and must be sent
        at least 48 hours prior to the meeting time.
      <p>
        Events hosted by the club may be held online at a time not
        normally scheduled for a meeting. These events have no quorum
        and are entirely optional.
      <h2>Election Process</h2>
      <p>
        Elections shall take place at the end of each term for the
        following academic term. Only University of Waterloo students
        can vote. Club members must be notified, by email, two weeks
        in advance of the meeting where executive elections will take
        place. The term of office shall be for one term. An executive
        can only hold office (any position) for a total of three terms.
      <p>
        In the spirit of this club, elections will be conducted using
        a provably fair and secure system. The Single Transferrable
        Vote system must be used. The voting will be done in person,
        but online votes are allowed if a club member provides a cryptographic
        public key, so that the club administration can verify the
        authenticity of the vote.
      <p>
        The voting system must satisfy all of the following requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          each club member must be able to cryptographically verify his
          or her vote was counted appropriately;
        <li>
          there must be reasonable certainty that all votes are anonymized;
        <li>
          the entire voting system must be open-source;
        <li>
          the voting system must be sufficiently accessible that all club
          members are able to use it.
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nominations for executives can be made from any club member.
        The majority of executives must be undergrad University of
        Waterloo students. The successful candidate will be the one
        determined by the Single Transferrable Vote algorithm, in
        particular the Wright System for STV. Ties must be broken by
        lot through a provably fair system.
      <h2>Impeachment and Disciplinary Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        A movement to impeach an executive officer may be made by any
        executive officer or by petition of at least five voting members.
      <p>
        When the motion is made the Clubs Manager will
        be informed. A general meeting will be called
        as soon as is reasonably possible. No club funds will be spent
        until the issue is resolved.
      <p>
        At the impeachment meeting, the person or persons that initiated
        the process will state their case. Afterwards, the officer under
        impeachment will have an opportunity to reply.
      <p>
        There will be a question period after which a vote will be taken
        by a CRO designated by an executive member who is neither initiator
        nor subject of the impeachment. If there is no such officer, any club
        member may volunteer. If there is more than one volunteer, the CRO
        will be selected based on a simple majority vote by secret ballot.
      <p>
        The vote will be by yes/no secret ballot. If at least two thirds
        of the votes are for impeachment, the officer will immediately be
        stripped of his or her position. The remaining executive may
        choose to call an immediate by-election to replace that officer.
      <h2>Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        Constitutional amendments may be proposed by any executive officer
        or by petition of at least five voting members. The amendment will
        then be voted on by referendum. The voting procedure will be the
        same as for the impeachment process.
      <p>
        If the vote passes, the amendment and the vote will be passed to
        the Clubs Manager for final approval from the Internal
        Administrative Committee. If it is approved the constitution will be
        amended and any changes will be inserted into the constitution.
      <h2>Affiliations</h2>
      <p>
        We are not currently affiliated with any organizations. Any
        additional affiliations must be added by following the amendment
        process and amending this constitution to reflect any changes in
        the affiliation section and is at the discretion of the Internal
        Administration Committee.
